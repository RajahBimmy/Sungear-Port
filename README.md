## Welcome to Sungear

Sungear enables rapid, visually interactive exploration of large sets of genomic data. It allows browsing of gene sets by experiment membership, gene annotation, and ontological term. The purpose of Sungear is to make otherwise complicated queries quick and visually intuitive.

* __Microarray data__: This dataset was generated from published microarray studies that identified Arabidopsis genes regulated by transient treatments with the nutrients nitrogen (N) and or carbon (C) (Price, J., et al. (2004) Plant Cell 16, 2128-2150; Scheible, W.-R., et al. (2004) Plant Physiol. 136, 2483-2499; Wang, R., et al. (2004) Plant Physiol 136, 2512-2522. ). In this example, six lists of genes containing N- or CN-regulated genes (I= induced; D= depressed) provide the anchors for Sungear. These experiments conducted by three different research groups all share the feature of transiently treating Arabidopsis seedlings with nitrogen or nitrogen plus carbon nutrients, and assaying gene responses using the ATH1 Affymetrix whole genome chips.

* __Comparative Genomics__: This dataset was generated from a BLASTP comparison of all Arabidopsis thaliana protein sequences to the protein sequences in C. elegans (worm), D. melanogaster (fly), H. sapiens (human), M. musculus (mouse), R. norvegicus (rat), S. cerevisiae (yeast), S. pombe (fission yeast), and a collection of Cyanobacterial, Archaea and bacterial genomes, as described previously (GutiÃ©rrez et al. 2004). In this analysis, the Arabidopsis proteins are the "background" used for annotation (Gene names and GO terms).

* __Developmental Time Course__: Microarray Experiments from different developmental time points of Arabidopsis thaliana ( Shmid et al 2005 ) were grouped into different developmental stages (Seedling, Young Plants, Mature Plants, Flowering Plants, and Seed Development). Genes that were determined to be differentially expressed (using inhouse statistical analysis) were plotted using Sungear.
